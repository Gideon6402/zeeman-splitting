Welcome to this repository!

The C++ part converts the data in ubuntu-data/ into the data in processed-data/.

The Python part does all the rest. It is responsible for the plots in the report-plots folder. Old junk is not used (the functions don't even exist anymore) but have a look if you are interested.
